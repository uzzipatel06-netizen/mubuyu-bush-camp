                    <h5 class="text-primary">What should I pack?</h5>
                    <p>Neutral-colored clothing (khaki, olive, beige) is best for safaris. Don't forget a hat,
                        sunscreen, binoculars, and a good camera. Evenings can be cool, so a light jacket is
                        recommended.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h5 class="text-primary">Is it safe?</h5>
                    <p>Safety is our top priority. Our guides are highly trained professionals, and the camp is designed
                        to ensure guest security while maintaining an authentic bush feel.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-primary">Do I need a visa?</h5>
                    <p>Visa requirements for Zambia vary by nationality. Many visitors can obtain a visa on arrival or
                        apply for an e-visa in advance. We recommend checking with your local embassy.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-primary">Are kids allowed?</h5>
                    <p>Due to the intimate and wild nature of the camp, we generally recommend Mubuyu for children aged
                        12 and over, though we can make exceptions for exclusive camp bookings.</p>
